# Introduction to Python Data Structures

This was a guided project from Coursera to get more familiar with the data structures in python. I created a quiz, using a list to store words, a set to ensure no duplicates, a
tuple to extract the words from their defintions, a dictionary to map the words to their definitions and a short program to give a user a word and list of defintion choices and
accept user input for the answer.

Although this was a very simple project, it gave me the oppotunity to use these data structures in a practical way and was a great introduction to Python, I'm excited to continue 
exploring the language and create more exciting and complicated projects!
